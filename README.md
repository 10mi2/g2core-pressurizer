# g2core Pressurizer

A prototype emergency ventilator project based on [g2core](https://github.com/synthetos/g2/tree/pressurizer)

# Flow sensor

[![Flow sensor animation](flow-sensor/v32.2-Animation.gif)](flow-sensor)

As a subproject, a 3D-printable and home-manufacturable flow sensor that can be used for any ventilator or stand-alone can be found in the [flow-sensor](flow-sensor) subdirectory.

# What is this?

See the blog posts [Designing an Intelligent IoT Ventilator From Home, Pt. 1](https://tenmilesquare.com/designing-an-intelligent-iot-ventilator-from-home-pt-1/) for an introduction and [Designing an Intelligent IoT Ventilator From Home, Pt. 2](https://tenmilesquare.com/designing-an-intelligent-iot-ventilator-from-home-pt-2/) for more detailed theory of operation.
